Numpy is a one of  library, which we are using in python
Mainly using for list working with array 
NumPy arrays are stored at one continuous place in memory unlike lists, so processes can access and manipulate them very efficiently.
This behavior is called locality of reference in computer science.
This is the main reason why NumPy is faster than lists. Also it is optimized to work with latest CPU architectures.
